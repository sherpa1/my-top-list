The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album.\" The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to \"the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff\""),

Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius)."),
